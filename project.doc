AI-Powered School Examination Platform
1️⃣ HIGH-LEVEL SYSTEM OVERVIEW 🏗️
Core Principle

Backend (Laravel) is the single source of truth
Frontend (Desktop App) is stateless UI only

[ Desktop App (Electron / WPF) ]
            |
        HTTPS + JWT
            |
[ Laravel API (Auth + Logic) ]
            |
[ AI Engine + OCR + Jobs ]
            |
[ MySQL Database ]

2️⃣ TECHNOLOGY STACK (FINAL) 🔒
Backend

Laravel 11 (API-only)

MySQL (authoritative DB)

Redis (queues & jobs)

Laravel Sanctum or JWT

wkhtmltopdf / DomPDF

Desktop App

Electron.js (Linux dev → Windows build)

React (optional)

SQLite (encrypted cache)

AI

LLM (OpenAI / Gemini / local)

Tesseract OCR (PDFs)

3️⃣ DATABASE DESIGN (FOUNDATION) 🗄️
Core Tables
users
roles
user_roles
pdf_uploads
exams
exam_questions
exam_codes
exam_sessions
student_answers
results
ai_logs
audit_logs
sync_queue

Authority Rule ⚠️

MySQL = FINAL

SQLite = TEMPORARY
